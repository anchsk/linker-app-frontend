Note:
I started working on Linker App after completing the project for the Full Stack Open 2020 course. The original assignment was to build a Bloglist app where users can save links to blog articles and add likes. I enjoyed making that project so I built another version with some new features.

The code of the previous versions of this app is in the [fullstackopen2020](https://github.com/anchsk/fullstackopen2020) submissions repo.  
– [bloglist-backend](https://github.com/anchsk/fullstackopen2020/tree/master/part4/bloglist-backend)   
– [bloglist-frontend](https://github.com/anchsk/fullstackopen2020/tree/master/part5/bloglist-frontend) (without Redux and styling)  
– [bloglist-redux-frontend](https://github.com/anchsk/fullstackopen2020/tree/master/part7/bloglist-redux-frontend) (with Redux and react-bootstrap)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
